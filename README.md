# Discrete Mathematics with C
A collection of C programs that implement fundamental concepts of Discrete Mathematics.

## Concepts Covered
- Set theroy and operations
- Fuzzy logic and operations
- Relations and equivalence relations
- Boolean matrix operations
- Graph alogrithms - Dijkstra, Prim's
- Recursion-based algorithms
- Large integer arithmetic
- Truth tables and logic validity
- Permutations and Combinations

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0voidcode/discrete-math-in-c.git
```

2. **Compile and run using Makefile**
```bash
make run program="folder/program.c"
```

## Purpose
This repository serves as a practical reference for students studying **Discrete Mathematics**, helping bridge theoretical concepts with real coding exercises in **C language.**
